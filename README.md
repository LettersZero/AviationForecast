 Developing a Vendor-Product Procurement Forecasting System Using NIIN Data 

Project Definition

The Developing a Vendor-Product Procurement Forecasting System Using NIIN Data project addresses inefficiencies in procurement forecasting for the aviation, construction, maritime, and land industries. This system aims to optimize purchasing and inventory planning by predicting future procurement needs using historical data. Key data elements include vendor codes (CAGE), product identifiers (NIIN numbers, government-provided part numbers), unit prices, quantities, and procurement dates.
Synthetic data from Haystack Gold, a defense parts and logistics management software, was used for this project. Key variables include:
NIIN (National Item Identification Number): Identifies supply items.
CAGE (Commercial and Government Entity): Identifies suppliers or government agencies.
Government procurement: The process of purchasing goods and services for government use.
Government solicitation: A request for companies to bid on government procurement.
This project required an understanding of compliance and regulatory standards, such as CAGE and NIIN codes, and the use of data management systems to handle fragmented data. In CS 210: Data Management in Data Science, we learned the importance of cleaning datasets and using queries to connect fragmented data, a critical aspect of this project given the fragmented nature of Haystack Goldâ€™s data. SQLite was employed for effective data management.
Compliance plays a crucial role in industries like aviation, ensuring traceability and adherence to industry regulations. Structured procurement processes help reduce legal risks, maintain product quality, and enhance safety, particularly in highly regulated sectors.
